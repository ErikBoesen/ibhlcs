Notes and programming assignments for IB HL Computer Science I and II (2017-2019).

## IAs
My Junior year IA project can be found [here](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/euler).

## Extended Essay
Much of my work during this class was on my IB Extended Essay, which I wrote on a Computer Science topic. My paper and relevant code can be found in a [separate repository](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/ee), which I've kept professional and cleaner than this repository.
