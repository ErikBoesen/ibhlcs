# Implementation methods
* Direct change-over - go straight from old system to new system "overnight." Will often frustrate users, but is fast. Training: Usually bring someone in.
* Parallel running - run both systems at the same time +Gives users time to get used to new system -You will need double the IT, and people can just stay where they're comfortable. Training: generally videos.
* Pilot running - select group of users switch over early. +Finds problems w/ only a subset of people. -Double IT.
* Phased conversion - Gradually tweak small parts of the software. +Slow, people unlikely to get upset. -Expensive and slow. Training: videos or none at all

* Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) - Company provides access to and maintenance of software eg. Netflix, Spotify, Adobe.
* HR - people running computers you use.
* Roles of computer in a network:
    * Client
    * Server
        * E-mail server
        * DNS server (keeps track of what domains correspond to what IPs)
    * Router
    * Firewall
