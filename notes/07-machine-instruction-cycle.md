## Machine Instruction Cycle (Von Neumann Architecture)
* Fetch instruction
* Decode instruction
* Execute
* Store the results

### Fetch
* An instruction is transferred from the memory address stored in the program counter (PC)
* Then stored in the Instruction Register (IR)
* PC points it to the next instruction

### Decode
Instruction in the IR is decoded.

### Execute
Control Unit (CU) passes decoded information to relevant functions such as reading values from registers or passing values to the ALU which **performs math and logic** and writing result back to register.

### Store
The result generated by the operation is stored in the main memory.
