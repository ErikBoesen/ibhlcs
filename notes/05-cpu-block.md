# CPU block (called Motherboard outside IB)
* Wires - "busses"
    * Address & data
* Primary memory
    * RAM: Volatile
    * ROM: Non-volatile
    * Cache is part of RAM, very fast and expensive.
        Types of cache in IB curriculum: Static RAM & Dynamic RAM.
    * Computer stores things it will need quickly for the CPU in cache to speed up processor
* CPU memory: Registers
    * Memory address (MAR)
    * Memory data (MDR)
* Secondary Memory/Persistent Memory
    * HDD, SSD, tapes, USB drive, rewritable DVD, etc.
$ --> $$$: HDD, SSD, RAM, ROM, Cache, Registers
Also slowest --> fastest.
* Processor contains:
    * Registers
        * Data register: holds data memory
        * Instruction register: holds instruction code
        * Address register: holds the address
    * Accumulator: processor register
    * Program counter: holds the address of current instruction
    * ALU: Arithmetic Logic Unit
