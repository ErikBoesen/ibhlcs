# Topic 1 - System Fundamentals
* SaaS: Software as a Service. Cloud based services offering subscription-based software.
    * The software for working per your need _What?_
    * Downloading the software locally might or might not be required, but data is stored in cloud.
    * SaaSs hould be fast enough to provide services to people.
    * When need for space reduces, software should release extra space.
    * Billed only for the service you use.
* Conversion systems (from previous notes)

* Causes of data loss:
    * Hardware malfunction
    * User error
    * Software corruption
    * Computer virus
    * Natural Disaster
* Consequences of data loss
    * Companies: loss of productivity, reputation, value of data, trust
    * Clients: loss of private information, reputation, theft
* Methods of preventing data loss
    * Backup (cloud-based service)
    * Anti-virus with updates
    * Keep machine dry in shaded, dust-free and ventilated area
* Releasing updates: automate updates to fix bugs and minor issues.
* Hardware: physical components of a system
* Software: the instructions
* Peripheral: piece of hardware which is optional and expands capabilities of computer
* Network: two or more computers which are linked in order to share resources and exchange files/data
* Human resources: people needed to set up, run, and maintain a computer system (IT people)
* Methods of data collection:
    * Surveys: gather lots of data, quickly and inexpensively. However, you cannot gather detailed data (low response depth) and number of responses are limited.
    * Interviews: gather very deep data, with opportunity for users to elaborate upon specific qualms. Very personal information. However, it is time consuming and there is potential for personal bias.
    * Direct observation: you get to see how the users actually use the software, not how they think they do. However, Hawthorne Effect (change in behavior because users know they are being observed) may occur.
* Type of computers:
    * Client
    * Server
    * Email server
    * DNS server
    * Router
    * Firewall
