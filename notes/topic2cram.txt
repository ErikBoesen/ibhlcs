Parts of CPU:
Types of memory: fastest -> slowest
- Registers: the CPU's memory
- Cache: main memory on or near CPU which is used for data which must be held in memory very briefly. Primary memory.
- RAM: volatile main memory
- ROM: BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), main memory, non-volatile
- Secondary memory: SSD/HDD

Registers:
- Data: holds data memory
- Instruction: holds instruction code
- Address: holds address
- Accumulator: processor register
- Program Counter: holds address of current instruction

Machine Instruction Cycle:
Fetch, Decode, Execute, Store

~(A + ~B) = ~A * B
~(A * ~B) = ~A + B

Operating Systems:
* Provide basic security
* Manage peripherals

* UI
* Manage memory
* Peripherals

Types of applications:
* Spreadsheet
