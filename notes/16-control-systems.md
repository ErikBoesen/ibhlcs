Control system: a device or set of devices that manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems.
Microprocessor: small integrated circuit that contains all the functions of a CPU in a computer. Typically has very few jobs, for example read sensor, determine if there's a car there, and change a traffic light if so.
Sensor: device which detects or measures a physical property and records, ind icates, or responds to it.
Evaluate different input devices: there are many for normal comptuers, like mouse, keyboard, joystick, mic, touch pad, light pen, trackball, digital camera, scanner.
Sensors can help people with disabilities (accessibility) to use computers in other ways.
IPO model: Input, Process, Output. Feedback arrow goes from Output back to Input. Sensors take analogue input and convert to digital data. Digital data goes to microprocessor, which produces digital output. Output transducer can then turn digital data into analogue signals to power real world devices.
Analogue to Digital Converter and Digital to Analogue Converter: other names for transducer. Transducer is a device that converts one type of data to another usable form.
